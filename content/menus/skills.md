I have several years experience with C++, and this is likely my language of
greatest proficiency. I have experience with command-line debugging tools, and
some experience with performance optimisation. That being said, I have not yet
experienced large-scale software development in C++.

I have some experience with Java, C, Python and Bash. While in no way do I
consider myself as experienced at any of these languages, I do have sufficient
experience for example to: develop a scanner & parser in Java for an invented
language; design and develop the core components of a single processor,
asynchronous operating system in C. This has given me some knowledge about
the inherent limitations of these languages, and how to avoid them.

Additionally, I have worked on projects involving Javascript / Typescript and
frontend mark-up. These have involved a mix of legacy and cutting-edge
technologies, including Perl and GraphQL.
